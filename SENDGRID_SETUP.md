## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys**:
   - Always use environment variables
   - Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
   - Use different keys for dev/staging/production

2. **Rate limiting** (optional but recommended):
   ```typescript
   // Add to apps/web/lib/rate-limit.ts
   import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
   
   const requests = new Map<string, number[]>()
   
   export function rateLimit(request: NextRequest, limit: number = 5) {
     const ip = request.ip || 'unknown'
     const now = Date.now()
     const windowMs = 60 * 1000 // 1 minute
     
     const userRequests = requests.get(ip) || []
     const recentRequests = userRequests.filter(time => now - time < windowMs)
     
     if (recentRequests.length >= limit) {
       return false
     }
     
     recentRequests.push(now)
     requests.set(ip, recentRequests)
     return true
   }
   ```

3. **Spam protection**:
   - Consider adding reCAPTCHA
   - Implement honeypot fields
   - Validate email domains
