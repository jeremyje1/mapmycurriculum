## Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. Authentication & Authorization üî¥
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk**: Cannot launch without proper auth

#### Current State
- Mock localStorage token in dashboard
- No user authentication flow
- No role-based access control
- Security vulnerability

#### Required Work
```typescript
// Tasks
- [ ] Integrate Supabase Auth across all pages
- [ ] Create middleware for route protection
- [ ] Implement sign-in/sign-up/sign-out flows
- [ ] Add password reset and email verification
- [ ] Create roles table (admin, editor, viewer)
- [ ] Implement RBAC checks in API routes
- [ ] Add role-based UI rendering
- [ ] Test auth flow end-to-end

// Files to modify/create
- apps/web/middleware.ts (expand protection)
- apps/web/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx (new)
- apps/web/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx (modify existing)
- apps/web/lib/auth.ts (new - auth helpers)
- apps/web/lib/rbac.ts (new - role checks)
- supabase/migrations/*_auth_roles.sql (new)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úì All dashboard routes require authentication
- ‚úì Users can sign in with email/password
- ‚úì Roles are enforced in API routes
- ‚úì Unauthorized access returns 401/403
- ‚úì Session management works correctly

---

### 2. Multi-Tenant Row-Level Security üî¥
**Priority**: P0 (Security Critical)  
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk**: Data leakage between institutions

#### Current State
- RLS only on compliance tables
- simple_programs, simple_courses, simple_alignments lack isolation
- No institutionId filtering in queries

#### Required Work
```sql
-- Tasks
- [ ] Audit all Supabase tables for RLS policies
- [ ] Add institutionId to relevant tables
- [ ] Create RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] Test cross-tenant access is blocked
- [ ] Update API routes to use user's institutionId
- [ ] Add institution context to all queries

-- Tables needing RLS
- simple_programs
- simple_courses  
- simple_alignments
- learning_outcomes
- scenarios (when created)
- subscriptions (when created)

-- Example policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their institution's programs"
ON simple_programs
FOR SELECT
USING (institution_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'institution_id');
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úì All tables have appropriate RLS policies
- ‚úì Users cannot query other institutions' data
- ‚úì Service role key only used in cron jobs
- ‚úì Security audit passed

---

### 3. Stripe Webhook & Subscription Management üî¥
**Priority**: P0 (Revenue Critical)  
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk**: Cannot collect payments or provision customers

#### Current State
- POST /api/checkout redirects to Stripe ‚úì
- No webhook handler to capture payment events ‚ùå
- No subscription tracking in database ‚ùå
- No institution provisioning after payment ‚ùå

#### Required Work
```typescript
// Tasks
- [ ] Create POST /api/stripe/webhook route
- [ ] Handle checkout.session.completed event
- [ ] Handle invoice.payment_succeeded event
- [ ] Handle invoice.payment_failed event
- [ ] Handle customer.subscription.* events

// Files to create
- apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts
- supabase/migrations/*_subscriptions.sql
- apps/web/lib/stripe-webhooks.ts
- apps/web/app/(dashboard)/billing/page.tsx
```

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  institution_id uuid REFERENCES institutions(id),
  stripe_customer_id text NOT NULL,
  stripe_subscription_id text NOT NULL,
  plan_id text NOT NULL, -- 'basic', 'professional', 'enterprise'
  status text NOT NULL, -- 'active', 'past_due', 'canceled', 'trialing'
  current_period_start timestamptz,
  current_period_end timestamptz,
  cancel_at_period_end boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),

);
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úì Webhook receives and validates Stripe events
- ‚úì Subscription status tracked in database
- ‚úì New institutions provisioned automatically
- ‚úì Failed payments trigger alerts
- ‚úì Customers can manage billing in dashboard

---

### 4. Data Import & Program Management üî¥

```

**CSV Format** (reference: demo-data/*.csv):
```csv
# programs.csv
code,name,degreeType,catalogYear
BSCS,Computer Science,BS,2025

# courses.csv  
subject,number,title,credits,cipCode

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Auth implementation delayed | CRITICAL | MEDIUM | Start immediately, dedicate full-time dev |
| Stripe webhook issues | HIGH | MEDIUM | Test thoroughly, implement retry logic |
| RLS bypass vulnerability | CRITICAL | LOW | Security audit, penetration testing |
| Data import errors at scale | MEDIUM | HIGH | Extensive validation, error handling |
| Rule pack evaluation performance | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Optimize, add caching, background jobs |
| Customer data loss | CRITICAL | LOW | Automated backups, DR plan, testing |

### Contingency Plans

**If auth implementation falls behind**:
- Reduce scope: basic email/password only initially
- Delay social auth providers
- Use Supabase auth UI components (faster)

**If Stripe integration is complex**:
- Manual provisioning initially
- Async webhook processing
- Hire Stripe consultant if needed

**If testing timeline is tight**:
- Focus on critical path E2E tests
- Add unit tests incrementally post-launch
- Use manual QA for first customers
