compliance_monitor_runs (
  id, run_date, total_programs, compliant_count, 
  warning_count, critical_count, summary_data
)

-- Stores program-level snapshots over time
compliance_snapshots (
  id, program_code, check_date, status,

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Week 1: Accreditation Reports

**No deployment needed** - API route is server-side and auto-deployed with Next.js app.

Test endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/report/accreditation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test-request.json \
  --output test-report.pdf
```

### Week 2: Scenario Modeling

**No deployment needed** - Page component is part of Next.js app.

Access at: `https://platform.mapmycurriculum.com/enterprise/dashboard/scenarios`

### Week 3: Automated Monitoring

1. **Set Environment Variable** (Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables):
   ```
   CRON_SECRET=<generate-secure-random-string>
   ```

2. **Deploy vercel.json** (already done - cron config included)

3. **Verify Cron Setup** (Vercel Dashboard → Cron Jobs):
   - Should show: `/api/cron/compliance-monitor` scheduled for "0 2 * * 0"

4. **Manual Test**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://platform.mapmycurriculum.com/api/cron/compliance-monitor?key=YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
   ```

5. **Create Database Tables** (Supabase SQL Editor):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE compliance_monitor_runs (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     run_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
     total_programs INT,
     compliant_count INT,
     warning_count INT,
     critical_count INT,
     summary_data JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE compliance_snapshots (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     program_code TEXT NOT NULL,
     check_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
     status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('compliant', 'warning', 'critical')),
     passed_rules INT,
     failed_rules INT,
     warning_rules INT,
     critical_issues TEXT[],

     alert_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
     severity TEXT CHECK (severity IN ('warning', 'critical')),
     issues TEXT[],
     notified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

### Week 4: New RulePacks

**No deployment needed** - RulePacks are static YAML files loaded at runtime.

Validate locally:
```bash
pnpm state:validate US-CA 2025.09
pnpm state:validate US-FL 2025.09
pnpm state:validate US-NY 2025.09
